GM:
You blink awake to the crunch of broken wood and splintered canvas beneath you. The cold bite of early morning air brushes your skin, and a faint smell of pine and smoke fills your nostrils.

Beside you lies a caravan wreck—its wooden wheels twisted, canvas tarps torn open like wounded beasts. The once‑bright banners are tattered, and a few scattered crates spill their contents: a cracked lantern, a sack of dried herbs, and a tarnished silver brooch etched with an unfamiliar crest.

Your head throbs, and you realize you can’t recall who you are or how you got here. Your clothes are simple—leather boots, a rough‑spun shirt, and a belt with an empty pouch.

Two paths lie before you:

* **The road** – a narrow, dirt‑filled track that snakes out of the forest, disappearing into the horizon. It looks well‑traveled, with faint tire tracks leading away.

* **The trail** – a narrow, overgrown footpath winding into the darkening trees, half‑obscured by ferns and fallen leaves. It seems to lead deeper toward the heart of the forest.

The sun is just beginning to rise, casting long shadows across the wreckage. The forest ahead is quiet, but you can hear the distant call of a raven and the rustle of small creatures in the underbrush.

What do you do?

PLAYER:
Follow the trail

GM:
You push through the tangled underbrush, the trail narrowing as the trees close in. I’ll roll a Survival check to see how well you navigate.

*Rolls d20…* **14** → +2 Survival = **16**.

Your steps are sure; you avoid the hidden roots and low branches that would have tangled a less careful traveler. About a hundred meters in, you spot a faint, moss‑covered stone archway half hidden by vines—a relic of an old druidic circle. A faint glow pulses from within, and the air feels cooler.

**What do you do?**

PLAYER:
What was my last action?

GM:
Your last action was to follow the overgrown trail into the forest, navigating the tangled underbrush and discovering a moss‑covered stone archway that glows faintly from within.
